# Privacy Policy
Effective date: 27 April 2021

We respect your privacy and believe that the less we know about you, the better both for you and for us. In fact, we do not collect any personal data through JSTColorPicker unless you voluntarily provide it to us (e.g., by sending a support email or subscribing to a newsletter). We limit the information we collect to the minimum necessary to provide you with our service and improve JSTColorPicker. Our business is developing and selling software, not your personal data.

Below, we've provided detailed information on when and why we collect your personal data and how we use it. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully before providing any personal data to us.

## Owner and operator of JSTColorPicker

The desktop application JSTColorPicker (collectively, "JSTColorPicker") and the related website https://82flex.com/jstcpweb (the "Website") are owned and operated by 82Flex Team ("__we__", "__us__", and "__our__"), registered in Room 601, Build H1, Intercity Space Station, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.

When we ask you to provide us with your personal data or if you contact us, we act as a data controller with regard to your personal data. It means that we are responsible for deciding what personal data can be collected from you and how it can be used.

## Data storage

JSTColorPicker stores your data (image annotations and tags) in binary and human-readable formats locally on your Mac device.

These data is not transferred to or stored on our servers, nor do we have access to, own, or use this data in any other manner.

## Usage analytics

We do not collect any information about the way you use JSTColorPicker.

## Crash reporting

If JSTColorPicker crashes while you're using it, we collect anonymized data about the crash to help us identify and hopefully fix the issues in a future update. This data contains information such as the state of the application, operating system, and device that you use. It does not include your personal data, and we cannot identify you as a natural person.

We use [App Center](https://appcenter.ms/ "App Center") to collect and analyze crash reports.

## Payments

When you make payments related to JSTColorPicker, you submit your payment details to Apple that process your payments. We do not collect your payment data and do not have any access to it. Please refer to the privacy policies of Apple to check how they process your payment data.

## Cookies

We do not use any cookies on the Website or JSTColorPicker.

## Support interactions

When you contact us via a contact form on the Website, a chat widget available on the Website, or by sending us an email, we collect your email address, name, and any other information you provided in your message voluntarily. This information is collected to help resolve your inquiry. If you would like to remove the emails you have sent, please let us know. The legal basis on which we rely is "pursuing our legitimate business interests (i.e., grow and maintain JSTColorPicker and the Website) and "your consent" (for optional personal data that you voluntarily provide).

We use [Gmail](https://gmail.com/ "Gmail") for customer support.

## Marketing messages

We do not send any marketing messages.

## What if you refuse to provide your personal data?

If you decide not to provide us with your personal data when requested, we may not be able to perform the requested operation (e.g., to reply to you).

## Disclosure of your personal data to third parties

We do not disclose your personal data to third parties unless it is necessary for the operation of JSTColorPicker, the Website, or pursuing our legitimate business interests. Our data processors are the service providers that may have access to some of your personal data. You can find a list of processors that may have access to your personal data in the sections that describe the types of personal data collected by us.

When disclosing your personal data to our data processors, we make sure that the recipient can ensure an adequate level of protection to your personal data. For example, we make sure that the jurisdiction in which the recipient third party is located guarantees an adequate level of protection to personal data, or we conclude an agreement with the respective third party that ensures such protection (e.g., a data processing agreement based pre-approved standard contractual clauses).

We do not ever sell your personal data to third parties.

## Protection of your data

We use industry-appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, and disclosure. The security measures used by us include secured networks, strong passwords, limited access to your personal data by our staff, and anonymization of personal data (when possible).

## Managing your data

You can exercise your rights listed below, unless, in very limited cases, the applicable law provides otherwise:

* __Right of access__: you can get a copy of your personal data that we store in our systems and a list of purposes for which your personal data is processed;
* __Right to rectification__: you can rectify inaccurate personal data that we hold about you;
* __Right to erasure__ ('right to be forgotten'): you can ask us to erase your personal data from our systems;
* __Right to restriction__: you can ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data;

If you would like to exercise any of your rights, please contact us by email at [82flex@gmail.com](mailto:82flex@gmail.com "82flex@gmail.com") and explain your request in detail. In order to verify the legitimacy of your request, we may ask you to provide us with an identifying piece of information that allows us to identify you in our system. We will answer your request within a reasonable time frame but no later than 30 days.

If you would like to launch a complaint about the way in which we process your personal data, we kindly ask you to contact us first and express your concerns. If we receive your complaint, we will investigate it and provide you with our response as soon as possible. If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your complaint, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

We do not discriminate you if you decide to exercise your rights. It means that we will not (i) deny any goods and services, (ii) charge you different prices, (iii) deny any discounts or benefits, (iv) impose penalties, or (v) provide you with a lower quality service.

## Storage period

We store your personal data only as long as such personal data is necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or until you request us to delete your personal data. After your personal data becomes no longer necessary for its purposes and there is no other legal basis for storing it, we will immediately securely delete such personal data from our databases and service providers.

Your non-personal data may be retained for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including for the time period needed for us to pursue our legitimate business interests. In certain cases prescribed by law, we are obliged to store your personal data for a limited period of time (e.g., for archiving our business records). In such cases, we store relevant personal data for the time period required by the applicable law and delete the personal data as soon as the required retention period expires.

## Updates and questions

This Privacy Policy becomes active on the date indicated at the beginning of it. We may make changes to the Privacy Policy at any time. Up-to-date information will always be available on this page.
