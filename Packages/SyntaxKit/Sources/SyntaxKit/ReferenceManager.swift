//  Patterns.swift
//  SyntaxKit
//
//  A utility class to facilitate the creation of pattern arrays.
//  It works it the following fashion: First all the pattern arrays should be
//  created with patterns:inRepository:caller:. Then
//  resolveReferencesWithRepository:inLanguage: has to be called to resolve all
//  the references in the passed out patterns. So first lots of calls to
//  patterns and then one call to resolveReferences to validate the
//  patterns by resolving all references.
